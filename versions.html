                    <div class="version-info">Though several smaller-scale changes were made to the site since its initial release, this is the first noteworthy version change. It mainly relates to the background on the site changing, which necessitated changes to the formatting of text (putting a slightly transparent background on everything). Furthermore, the favicon was updated, and several other stylistic updates were made. This marks the first official version change since release. Several small changes will be made in the near future, likely to be recognized in the version log (unlike some previous changes).</div>

It is simple, containing only a main page with a picture and several links. A more complex site is in the works but is not fully complete. That's why this simpler version is currently at this domain. </div>
